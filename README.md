# AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN sample applications 

AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN enables you to set up a private LoRaWAN network by connecting your devices and gateways with no LoRaWAN Network Server setup required. This repository contains resources to quickly get started developing solutions using AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN. It includes samples for typical design patterns ([binary decoder](transform_binary_payload), [downlink messaging](send_downlink_payload), [Thing shadow update](iotthingshadow)) and fully functional applications ([dashboards](timestream), [condition monitoring and alarming](soilmoisture_alarming)).

Please consider our [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan.html) to learn how to connect your wireless devices and gateways to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.  Please also consider [automation guidelines](automation) to learn how to use AWS CLI to automate tasks (e.g. configuration of a new gateway).

## Samples for typical design patterns

- [Decoding binary payloads from LoRaWAN devices](transform_binary_payload)  
    LoRaWAN devices typically send uplink payloads as binary encoded messages. In this sample you will learn how to decode a binary message from your LoRaWAN device and integrate the decoded payload with more than 17 AWS services using AWS IoT Rules. Example decoders for the following devices are included: Axioma W1,Browan Tabs Object Locator, Dragino LHT65/LGT01/LSE01, Elsys, GlobalSat LT-100. [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) to example binary decoders are welcome.

- [Sending downlink payload to a LoRaWAN device](send_downlink_payload)  
    In this sample you will learn how to implement different options for sending downlink payload to your LoRaWAN devices. It includes examples for AWS SDK, AWS CLI and AWS IoT Core message broker.

- [Updating IoT Thing shadow with decoded device payload](iotthingshadow)  
    AWS IoT Thing [Shadows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html) can make a deviceâ€™s state available to apps and other services whether the device is connected to AWS IoT or not. In this sample you will learn how to update the shadow of an AWS IoT Thing with the telemetry from a LoRaWAN device. 

## Fully functionable sample applications

- [Visualizing telemetry and transmission metadata from LoRaWAN devices with Amazon Timestream and Grafana plugin](timestream)  
    In this sample you will learn how to store telemetry from your LoRaWAN Devices as well as transmission metadata (e.g. RSSI and SNR per gateway) into Amazon Timestream. Afterwards you will learn how to visualize time series data in Grafana using a [Grafana plugin for Amazon Timestream](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-timestream-datasource/installation). 

- [Monitoring and alarming of soil moisture by using AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN and AWS IoT Events](soilmoisture_alarming)  
    Detecting events based on telemetry data from connected devices is a common use case in IoT across many industries. This sample explains how to integrate AWS IoT Events with LoRaWAN for IoT Core. You can learn how to translate telemetry values from a LoRaWAN device into events and notify users about these events using E-Mail and SMS.

## Included binary decoders
LoRaWAN devices often encode transmitted data in a binary format, as it increases transmission efficiency and improves battery lifetime. However, as the data arrive in the cloud, many use cases require a structured format. Transforming the binary data into JSON, for example, enables filtering and enrichment using [AWS IoT SQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-sql-reference.html) as well as integration with further AWS services using [AWS IoT Rule Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rule-actions.html).

The sample [Decoding binary payloads from LoRaWAN devices](transform_binary_payload) repository contains examples of binary decoders. Please note that all decoders are provided without any guarantee to fit for any specific purpose and are only intended for use in a laboratory or prototyping environment. The list below is not to be understood as a recommendation of specific manufacturers or specific device models. AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN supports any LoRaWAN device that complies with LoRaWAN specifications 1.0.x and 1.1.
