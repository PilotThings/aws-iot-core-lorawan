# AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN sample applications 
AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN enables you to set up a private LoRaWAN network by connecting your devices and gateways with no LoRaWAN Network Server setup required.

In this repository you will find fully functional sample applications to quickly get started developing solutions using AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN. Please also consider our [developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/connect-iot-lorawan.html) to learn how to connect your wireless devices and gateways to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN.

# Sample applications

- [A "Hello world" application: decoding LoRaWAN binary payloads using AWS IoT Rules and AWS Lambda](transform_binary_payload)  
    LoRaWAN devices typically send uplink payloads as binary encoded messages. In this sample you will learn how to decode a binary message from your LoRaWAN device and republish the decoded payload to the MQTT topic of AWS IoT Core. To support you in implementation of more advanced use cases, this sample contains two additional optional sections: guidelines on how to use AWS IoT Rules to integrate the decoded payload with more than 17 AWS services, and guidelines on how to build and deploy a binary decoder for your LoRaWAN device.  

- [Visualizing telemetry and transmission metadata from LoRaWAN devices with Amazon Timestream and Grafana plugin](timestream)  
    In this sample you will learn how to store telemetry from your LoRaWAN Devices as well as transmission metadata (e.g. RSSI and SNR per gateway) into Amazon Timestream. Afterwards you will learn how to visualize time series data in Grafana using a [Grafana plugin for Amazon Timestream](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-timestream-datasource/installation). 

- [Monitoring and alarming of soil moisture by using AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN and AWS IoT Events](soilmoisture_alarming)  
    Detecting events based on telemetry data from connected devices is a common use case in IoT across many industries. This sample explains how to integrate AWS IoT Events with LoRaWAN for IoT Core. You can learn how to translate telemetry values from a LoRaWAN device into events and notify users about these events using E-Mail and SMS.

- [Updating IoT Thing shadow with decoded device payload](iotthingshadow)  
    AWS IoT Thing [Shadows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html) can make a deviceâ€™s state available to apps and other services whether the device is connected to AWS IoT or not. In this sample you will learn how to update the shadow of AWS IoT Thing with the telemetry from a LoRaWAN device.
